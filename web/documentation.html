          <h3>Database / Inheritance strategy</h3>
          <p>Our database is built on MySQL using JPA with EclipseLink to achieve Object Relational Mapping.  </p>
          <p>First we created the MySQL database with SQL. We thought, as recommended by the teachers, that it would be the proper approach to generate the entities from the database. However, since MySQL does not support inheritance, we had to change our approach towards building the database and entities. </p>
          <p>In our second attempt we created the Entities first with the appropriate annotations for achieving the correct entity relations in the database. After creating the Entity-classes, we generated the database from these. This solved our problem, since we could add inheritance when writing in Java with JPA Annotations. It would have been nice to have known this from the start, since both strategies have been backed by different teachers. </p>
